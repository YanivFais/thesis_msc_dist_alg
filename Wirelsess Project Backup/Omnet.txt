1. Download from http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/#webInstall Visual c++ 2008 express edition (you may also download the MSDN package).
	i. register the program (help->register), registration is free.
3. Download Omnet++, http://www.omnetpp.org/filemgmt/viewcat.php?cid=2
	i. read the 'Readme.MinGW' file in the /doc foldr (for windows installation).
		a. Start mingwenv.cmd
		b. In the shell(unless there are changes in configure.user file):
			* > ./configure (==> TCL based (!!))
			* >make
			* By default the samples (in the 'samples' dir) will run
			  using the Tcl/Tk environment.
			* Starting the IDE by, >omnetpp
		c. For Reconfiguration of  the libraries please adress paragraph 3. 
		   in 'Readme.MinGW' file.
4. On the welcome screen, do the Tic-toc tutorial (it doesn't uses the IDE but gives some 
   understanding of the environment). (making a NED file, making a .cc file for a module, getName()
   command, cMessage object, etc.)
5. Open the HELP window and read "A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE OMNeT++ 4.0 IDE" - you should be able to
   do the 'tictoc' tutorial without using external editors.
6. Move on to the next tutorial "Enhancing the 2-node TicToc" (Adding watchs (e.g. WATCH), 
   limiting the number of messgaes, adding deubug output using EV variable, coloring compontets and
   changing the modules picture, extracting parameters from the 'ned' file using 'par', 
   using wildcards in 'ini' file, inheritence, modeling processing time using self messages and the 
   'scheduleAt()' command, Random numbers and parameters, 'bubble' command, Timeout, canceling timers
   using 'cancelEvent()' command [also in D'tors], retransmission of the same message).
7. Move on to the next tutorial "Turning it into a real network" (vector gates, module vector,
   the 'getIndex()' command, defining channels using the 'types' command,  two-way connections using
   inout gates, defining a new message class).
8. The next two tutorials concern statistics gathering, most intersting topic that will be studied
   later.
9. A Mobility framwork (MiXiM):
	i. download from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mixim/
	ii. Add the new project and build it CTL+b.
