Video playback example:
-----------------------

This directory contains an example of playing an video as a result of simulation.
The simulation was done on a grid and the destination node is 2 hops away from the source,the packet arrival times results are saved in the node1_str12.txt files and are replayed to RTP and played using VLC.
The example shows the original video as well as the network processed video (with some artifacts and delay).

To run this example run the play.sh file *inside a Cygwin shell*, you need to have VLC installed under c:/Program Files (x86)/VideoLAN/VLC or c:/Program Files/VideoLAN/VLC (otherwise change the play.sh script).
The script would open two windows, you may want to move them to be one next to the other.
