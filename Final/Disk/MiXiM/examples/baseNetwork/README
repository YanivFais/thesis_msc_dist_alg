This example shows the basic structure of an network using MiXiM.

The network consists of three hosts which use the CSMAMacLayer as MAC layer,
"SimplePathlossModel" as only AnalogueModel and a SNRThresholdDecider as Decider.

The used Network- and Application layer can be defined in the omnetpp.ini. As default
the BaseNetwLayer and BurstApplLayer are used.

You can use this network as an template for you own simulation.
