there is a generator and a simulator - they are separate entities.
you might want to separate the data graph, geography) between two files

Indeed, it is calculated by the generator

Algorithmically we will support only unicasts  currently, but the input format supports multicast. Am I missing something in the definition of multicast?

a. don't use the term broadcast. Engineers are very sensitive to the differences between braodcast, multicast, and unicast

b. from the LP point of view: multicasts are much harder. Perhaps we should separate them, or perhaps we could do the separation later (by counting the number of destinations). This is not crucial.
